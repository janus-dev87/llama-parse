It has resulted in a reduction in global demand for their Mobility offerings, while accelerating the growth of their Delivery offerings. The extent of the impact on the company's business and financial results is highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. It depends on various factors such as the duration of the outbreak, resurgences of the virus, the administration and efficacy of vaccines, government regulations, and potential permanent changes in user behavior. The pandemic has also affected the company's near-term financial results and may continue to impact their long-term financial results, leading to significant actions such as workforce reductions and changes to pricing models. Additionally, concerns over the economic impact of the pandemic have caused volatility in financial markets, which can negatively impact the company's stock price and access to capital markets.\n"
